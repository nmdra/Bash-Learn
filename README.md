# ðŸŒ€ The Messy Bash Learning Repo  

Welcome to **The Messy Bash Learning Repo**, where chaos meets clarity as I dive deep into **Bash scripting**! This repository documents my journey from **beginner to advanced** Bash scripting, complete with experiments, notes, and a lot of trial and error.  

> All learning resources are documented in the `notes/` directory.

> [!WARNING]  
> This repository is for **educational purposes only**. Some scripts may not follow best practices initially as they represent a learning curve. Use them at your own discretion and refine them as needed.  

Happy scripting! ðŸ˜Š
